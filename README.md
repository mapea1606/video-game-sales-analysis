# Video Game Sales Data Analysis

### **Project Overview**

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of a video game sales dataset. The goal was to explore key trends in the video game market by analyzing sales data for over 16,500 games. The analysis follows a standard data science workflow, from data cleaning and exploration to visualization and a final conclusion.

### **Key Findings**

* **Dominant Genres and Platforms**: The market is heavily concentrated, with the **Action** and **Sports** genres and the **DS** and **PS2** platforms having the highest number of game releases.
* **Skewed Sales Distribution**: The majority of games sell very few copies. The market is driven by a small number of blockbuster titles that generate a disproportionately large share of global sales.
* **Projected Market Trends**: The findings suggest a market where success is concentrated among a few major hits, indicating high competition for top-tier sales.

### **Project Structure**

* `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook (`Video_Game_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`) with all the code and analysis.
* `data/`: Stores the raw dataset (`vgsales.csv`) used for the analysis.

### **Tools and Libraries**

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

### **Dataset**

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle: [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)

### **Next Steps**

* Investigate the relationship between a game's rating, publisher, and its potential to become a top-selling title.
* Perform time-series analysis to model sales trends over time.
